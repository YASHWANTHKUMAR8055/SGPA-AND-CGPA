        <br>
        This is a website ,that calculates the sgpa and cgpa of a particular university<br>

        DESCRIPTION<br>
        <br>
        Computation of SGPA and CGPA
<p align="justify"> The following procedure to compute the Semester Grade Point
Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA):
i. The SGPA is the ratio of sum of the product of the number of
credits with the grade points scored by a student in all the
courses taken by a student and the sum of the number of
credits of all the courses undergone by a student,</p> i.e
SGPA (Si) = ∑(Ci x Gi) / ∑Ci <br>
where Ci is the number of credits of the ith course and Gi is the
grade point scored by the student in the ith course.
ii. The CGPA is also calculated in the same manner taking into
account all the courses undergone by a student over all the
semesters of a programme, i.e.
CGPA = ∑(Ci x Si) / ∑ Ci
where Si is the SGPA of the ith semester and Ci is the total
number of credits in that semester.
iii. The SGPA and CGPA shall be rounded off to 2 decimal places
and reported in the transcripts.
